# Grocery

Grocery is a Sinatra-based grocery list application that is meant to be managed on a mobile device. This application 
came from not being able to find a simple solution to creating and managing a grocery list from week to week and 
also be able to share it between multiple people so it can be kept up to date.

Just create a new list and then share the URL with whomever else you'd like to be able to modify the list.

## Running the app

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rackup
